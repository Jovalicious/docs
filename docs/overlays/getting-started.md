Next you'll neeed to pick your resolution and click the **START** button.

> Overlay size: Usually it should match your stream's resolution, or be smaller than it  - if you'd like to do the repositioning in your broadcasting software.

## AlertBox

The AlertBox is a native widget that displays live events from the queue in a popup-like behavior.

To create an AlertBox:

## Custom Widget
The Custom Widget is a native widget that you can use to display any content you want.
It is a good way to display your own content in overlay. It can consume local events (like tips, follows etc.) as well
as remote events read from a websocket or from a REST API.

To create a Custom Widget:

1. Click the **+** button in overlay editor
